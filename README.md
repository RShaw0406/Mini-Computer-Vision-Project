A computer vision project conducting several experiments on different images/videos.

Experiments include:

1. Grey level manipulation
2. Restoration of noisy images
3. Motion detection accuracy when salt and pepper noise is added
4. Background subtraction when motion is conintuous throughout video
5. A combination of frame differencing and background subtraction to identify unattended objects.
